## Overview

This is my first front End Dev project. It was a rather simple one, but throughout the procss i relized how much i still had to learn. I went in thinking this would take like 20 min, and it ended up taking over an hour. There were some css rules and conventions I totally fogot, but i enjoyed this a lot, i relearned a lot!!
